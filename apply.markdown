# How to Apply

## Application deadline: 15 February 2024

### Submission process
Admission to GlaMacLeS is determined based on a competitive application process, with applications evaluated by an advisory board in late February 2024.  Applications should be e-mailed to [Doug Brinkerhoff](glamacles@mso.umt.edu) ([glamacles@mso.umt.edu](glamacles@mso.umt.edu)) no later than February 15th, 2024.  All applicants will receive e-mail confirmation of their application within three days.  Successful applicants will be notified by March 1st, 2024.  Because both available funding for participant support as well as physical space are limited, the course is limited to 10 students.  
### Application Elements
Applications must consist of the following three elements:
1. a cover letter including your name, university affiliation, position, email address, and a statement describing how participation in this course would be beneficial to your research and professional development.  This letter should be limited to one page.  
2. a curriculum vita
3. a description of your proposed thesis/primary research interests.   This document does not need to include a full methodological description -- just a brief overview of your work.  In particular, emphasize how this research can utilize machine learning.  This document should describe major collaborations included as part of this effort, including the name of your thesis advisor or research supervisor.  

### Eligibility
The course is open to PhD students and postdoctoral researchers from anywhere in the world working in any facet of glaciology.  All qualified applicants will receive consideration without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.  Applicants will be selected based on a demonstrated potential benefit from the course as communicated in their application.   All students are expected to participate in the entire course, i.e. it is not possible to come later or leave earlier.
