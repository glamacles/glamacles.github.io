<p>GlaMacLes is held at the <a href="https://taft-nicholson.utah.edu/facilities-accommodations/index.php">Taft-Nicholson Center</a>in the Centennial Valley of Southwest Montana.   The TNC is immediately adjacent to the Red Rocks National Wildlife Refuge, which is critical habitat for a large number of bird and mammal species, and opportunities for wildlife viewing, hiking, and other activities abound.  As part of the course, students will have an opportunity to learn about the unique research and conservation efforts centered around the TNC.</p>

<p> Students will stay in the TNC's dormitories, and instructors will have individual accommodations in the center's cabins.  All accommodations have full kitchen and bath amenities, although internet access is only available in central locations.  Meals are provided, with available accommodations for any dietary restrictions.  Lectures and collaborative work will be held in one of the TNC's classrooms, which are equipped with whiteboards, projectors, power, and internet. </p>

<p> Course participants will meet at the University of Montana in Missoula, MT on June 14th, 2025 and will travel the 4.5 hours to the TNC together by van (with similar return travel on June 23rd).  Despite the modern amenities, the TNC is extremely remote, so participants should bring everything that they need, including medications, extra food, and other personal items.  There is no cell service.
