<p>This course is intended to provide students with a comprehensive overview of the rapidly-changing interface of glaciology with machine learning and artificial intelligence.  Key topics that may be covered include
</p>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>An overview of machine learning methods for glaciologists</li>
		<li>Adjoint models and backpropagation</li>
		<li>Deep learning for glaciological remote sensing</li>
		<li>Gaussian process emulation for model prediction</li> 
		<li>Deep learning-based emulation of ice physics</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<p>The course is primarily oriented towards PhD students and early-stage postdocs that have strong foundational knowledge in glaciology, glaciological modeling, or remote sensing, and that wish to integrate ML methods into their work while simultaneously working to establish a community of practice.</p> 

<p>The course will be held from June 14th-23rd and will include 4 days of interactive lectures by course instructors, 3 days of student project development in collaboration with course instructors, a one day excursion to nearby Yellowstone National Park, and two days for travel and orientation.  Previous instructors include</p>
